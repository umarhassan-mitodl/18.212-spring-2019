*   Partially ordered sets and lattices, Sperner's and Dilworth's theorems
*   _q_\-binomial coefficients, Gaussian coefficients, Young diagrams
*   Young's lattice, tableaux, Schensted's correspondence, RSK
*   Partitions, Euler's pentagonal theorem, Jacobi triple product
*   Noncrossing paths, Lindstrom lemma (aka Gessel-Viennot method)
*   Spanning trees, parking functions, Prufer codes
*   Matrix-tree theorem, electrical networks, random walks on graphs
*   Graph colorings, chromatic polynomial, Mobius function
*   Lattice paths, continued fractions
*   Enumeration under group action, Burnside's lemma, Polya theory
*   Transportation and Birkhoff polytopes, cyclic polytopes, permutohedra
*   Domino tilings, matching enumeration, Pfaffians, Ising model
